	<description>Adds a Reinforced version of some Stuff. This allows for stronger constructions. Reinforced stuff has 10x the hitpoints but at 5x build time. Reinforced Stuff is made from 10 Normal Stuff in a Molecular Reinforcement Compressor. Currently Reinforced Stuff can be made from Steel, Plasteel, Wood and Stone. </description>
